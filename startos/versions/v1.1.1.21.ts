    'Payout-address guard fix: the pool now validates the payout address by its CashAddr prefix (bitcoincash:/bchtest:/bchreg:) against the node’s network, instead of the node’s validateaddress RPC. Flowee the Hub’s validateaddress is legacy-base58-only and returns isvalid=false for any cashaddr, which previously made the guard wrongly reject valid cashaddr payout addresses when Flowee was the selected node. ckpool’s own runtime parsing remains the final authority.',
